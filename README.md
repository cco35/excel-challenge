Crowdfunding Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects to uncover trends and insights in the crowdfunding market. The analysis includes various aspects such as project outcomes, funding goals, backers, categories, launch dates, and more.

Project Structure

The project is structured into the following components:

Data Cleaning and Formatting:
Applied conditional formatting to the Outcome column to differentiate between successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns.
Calculated the Percent Funded for each campaign and applied conditional formatting based on a three-color scale.
Calculated the Average Donation per backer.
Categorized projects into Parent Category and Sub-Category columns for better analysis.
Category and Subcategory Analysis:
Utilized pivot tables and pivot charts to analyze campaign outcomes per category and sub-category.
Created a stacked-column pivot chart filtered by country and parent category for deeper insights.
Date Conversion:
Converted Unix timestamps in the launched_at and deadline columns into Excel's date format for easier analysis.
Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
Conducted analysis on campaign outcomes based on their launch dates using pivot tables and pivot-chart line graphs.
Crowdfunding Goal Analysis:
Created a table and graph showing the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled projects based on different crowdfunding goal ranges.
Utilized the COUNTIFS() formula for goal range analysis and visualization.
Statistical Analysis:
Evaluated the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns, calculating summary statistics like mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation.
Comprehensive Report:
A comprehensive report answering key questions and drawing conclusions from the analysis is provided in a separate Microsoft Word document within this repository.
