Thus repository contains my submission for assignment 1 in the Columbia Data Analytics Bootcamp. We were tasked wwith performing anaylysis on crowdfuding campaigns using MS Excel and various tools within excel such as Pivot Tables.
There are 2 files within this repository. One is the Excel file which houses the raw data used as welll as most of the analysis done spread across different worksheets. The other is a Word document which answers some questions related to the anlysis performed.
