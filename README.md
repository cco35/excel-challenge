# excel-challenge
This repository contains my submission for assignment 1 in the Columbia Data Analytics Bootcamp. We were tasked with performing analysis on crowdfunding campaigns using MS Excel and various tools within Excel such as Pivot Tables.
There are 2 files within this repository. One is the Excel file which houses the raw data used as well as most of the analysis done spread across different worksheets. The other is a Word document that answers some questions related to the analysis performed.
